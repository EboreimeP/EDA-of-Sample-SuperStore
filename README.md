#Visualization After the analysis, a dashboard was created to summarize and draw insight from the data

#The Superstore has a total profit of $286,397.02 #The consumer good contributed most to the profit (47%) while the least contributor was the home office goods (21%). #Categorically, Technology was the highest earner for the store (51%). Furniture performed poorly with only 6% contribution to the total profit. #A larger part of the profit were from California, New York, Washington, Michigan, Virginia, Indiana and Georgia. The store was in the red in Texas, Ohio, Pennysylvania, Illinois, North Carolina, Colorado, Tennessee, Arizona, Florida and Oregon. #Binders was our best seller with almost 6,000 sold, followed by paper. Copiers, machines and suppliers performed poorly, selling only 234, 440 and 647 respectively.

I have included region as filter for clearity and indept analysis.

#Recommendation.

The Sales and Advertisement department has to do more to make the store "visible" in Texas, Ohio, Pennysylvania, Illinois, North Carolina, Colorado, Tennessee, Arizona, Florida and Oregon. Promotional materials, incentives and commissions for sales persons can be considered.

The marketing strategy for Copiers, machines and suppliers is not working. This has to be reviewed!

The pricing policy for home office goods has to be reviewed in order to drive sales and ultimately profit for the store.
